# Hush Your Money

A web-based solution for CashShuffle (and a path to CashFusion) integration into the Bitcoin.com mobile wallet.

__https://devcon3.hushyourmoney.com/__

## Foreword

After learning that the Bitcoin.com wallet offered a __[3rd-party app API called Link](https://developer.bitcoin.com/bitcoincom-link/docs/getting-started/)__; I immediately made the move to join the __[BCHDevCon](https://devcon.cash)__. I believed this would offer me an ideal opportunity to finally connect with the Bitcoin.com wallet developers.

I've been working on a CashFusion solution for mobile since January, when I released the __[Nito Cash](https://gitlab.com/bchplease/nito.cash)__ web wallet, then later the __[NitoJS App](https://app.nitojs.org)__. Unfortunately, as I'm not on Telegram, I found it difficult to garner the attention and support of the Electron Cash or Bitcoin.com wallet teams for supporting my research efforts.

BCHDevCon3 has changed that! I've directly connected with __[Corbin Fraser (@maplesyrupsuckr)](https://twitter.com/maplesyrupsuckr/status/1302296467025981447)__, the lead developer of the Bitcoin.com wallet, and now... __it's time for daddy to go to work.__ ðŸ’ª

## Event Goals

Can't help but to be overly ambitious, so there are __THREE!__

### Goal 1: Establish a Bitcoin.com "working" relationship

As this was my motivation from the start; I value this as the top goal. Working directly with the team at Bitcoin.com would allow me the access & resources necessary to produce a CashFusion integration into their mobile wallet by end-of-year.

I strongly believe this would be the __greatest immediate boost for adoption__ (particularly amongst current crypto users) as the promise of anonymity is how Bitcoin was born and will surely be how it continues to thrive in the near future.

### Goal 2: Add a CashShuffle DApp to Discover

The Bitcoin.com wallet's __Discover__ tab offers in-app access to several 3rd-party services; some of which have direct wallet integration. __Bitcoin.com Hush__ will be the next integration released in Discover (at least if I have anything to say about it).

By offering Hush directly in-app, users are offered not only a better service experience, but the confidence in security that comes with a native integration.

### Goal 3: Build a privacy analyzer

> Inspiration for this comes from Blockchair's __[Privacy-o-meter](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/230460dc9daff1311f89048799f1ee05b26b05ec23083643f7c15669bc724467)__ as well as their __[excellent docs](https://blockchair.com/api/docs#link_M6)__.

Users will paste an __address__ or __transaction id__ into the analyzer and receive a __Privacy Score__ along with a detailed breakdown of the blockchain analysis data.

### Stretch Goal: Extend the Bitcoin.com Link API

There are currently 5 methods offered by the API: __`getAddress`__, __`sendAssets`__, __`payInvoice`__, __`createToken`__ and __`getWalletProviderStatus`__.

I would aim to add one new method called __`getAccount`__. This would specifically permit the application to call for the __Extended Public Key (xPub)__ of the wallet. With an xPub, we are able to query ALL addresses owned by the wallet, NOT only the "active" address.

__This would enable the application to:__

1. Automatically verify CashShuffle transaction success.
2. Provide automated wallet privacy analysis and alerts.
3. Provide custom address and transaction analysis.

_Due to the fact the Bitcoin.com mobile wallet is currently closed-source, this goal will be developed and tested using the __[Badger plugin for Chrome/Brave](https://badger.bitcoin.com/)__. Fortunately, the functionality should be nearly identical if the Bitcoin.com wallet developers should choose to extend it to their app as well._
