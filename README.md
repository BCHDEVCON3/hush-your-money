# Hush Your Money

A web-based solution for CashShuffle (and a path to CashFusion) integration into the Bitcoin.com mobile wallet.

## Foreword

After learning that the Bitcoin.com wallet offered a __[3rd-party app API called Link](https://developer.bitcoin.com/bitcoincom-link/docs/getting-started/)__; I immediately made the move to join the __[BCHDevCon](https://devcon.cash)__. I believed this would offer me an ideal opportunity to finally connect with the Bitcoin.com wallet developers.

I've been working on a CashFusion solution for mobile since January, when I released the __[Nito Cash](https://gitlab.com/bchplease/nito.cash)__ web wallet, then later the __[NitoJS App](https://app.nitojs.org)__. Unfortunately, as I'm not on Telegram, I found it difficult to garner the attention and support of the Electron Cash or Bitcoin.com wallet teams for supporting my research efforts.

BCHDevCon3 has changed that! I've directly connected with __[Corbin Fraser (@maplesyrupsuckr)](https://twitter.com/maplesyrupsuckr/status/1302296467025981447)__, the lead developer of the Bitcoin.com wallet, and now... __it's time for daddy to go to work.__ ðŸ’ª
